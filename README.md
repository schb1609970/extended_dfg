# extended_dfg

This github repository contains the package needed to perform the improved DFG visualization.
As explained in my bachelor thesis, the goal is to improve the DFG algorithm and visualization in PM4Py.
With this extension, implicit dependencies can be found from event logs and displayed in an improved visualization.
The folder "dfg_extended_discovery" contains both the improved algorithm, and the visualization.
"Data" contains the example event logs.

An example of how to use the package is found in "example.py".
Before you can use it, make sure to install the needed packages found in "requirements.txt".
Then, copy the folder "dfg_extended_discovery" into the directory containing all of the other packages.
